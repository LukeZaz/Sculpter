# Vectoray
3D modeling software prototype designed with an intuitive interface in mind.

Inspired by Blender and Hammer (for the Source Engine), *Vectoray* aims to create an OpenGL-based 3D modeling program 
easily understood and utilized without any prior experience in its usage.

Currently in heavy development with plans for a first version to arrive by the end of 2017.
**Latest development:** Movable camera & start of OpenGL C# wrapper backend.
