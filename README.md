# Vectoray

A 3D Game Engine portfolio/educational project written in C# using SDL2 and OpenGL. Currently being rewritten to reflect
my current coding standards and styling as well as generally improve performance and usability.

**Latest development:** Initial rewrite progress; creates a window, a context for it, and connects properly to OpenGL functions.
